# SymEngine.Swift [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ianruh/SymEngine.swift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ianruh/SymEngine.swift)

 A swift wrapper for [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine), a :zap:fâ€‹ast:zap: symbolic manipulation library, written in C++. This wrapper isn't complete yet, and PRs are welcome!

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is via Docker. First clone the repository, then build and run the container using:

```
$ docker build -t symengine.swift .
$ docker run --rm -it symengine.swift /bin/bash
```

Once the conatiner is started, you can run the example using `swift run example`.


## Getting Started

First import SymEngine:

```swift
import SymEngine
```

Then print the beautiful asci art:

```swift
print(SymEngine.asciiArt!)
//  _____           _____         _         
// |   __|_ _ _____|   __|___ ___|_|___ ___ 
// |__   | | |     |   __|   | . | |   | -_|
// |_____|_  |_|_|_|_____|_|_|_  |_|_|_|___|
//       |___|               |___|  
```

We can create some symbols in several different ways:

```swift
let x: Symbol? = Symbol(name: "x")
let one: Symbol = 1
let oneHalf: Symbol = 0.5
let expression: Symbol? = Symbol(parse: "3x^2 + 3*y")
```

However, notice that some of the symbols returned are optional as it is possible an initializer may fail. While the operations and functions in this wrapper have been designed to work with both optionals and non-optionals (returning non-optionals when possible), the compiler will yell at you until attention is paid to the optionality of the values you are working with.

## Installing

This is feels janky, but the only way I've found to work. If you know better I would love to find out.

1. Install SymEngine using conda: 

   ```
   $ conda install symengine -c conda-forge
   ```

2. The Swift Package Manager relies on `pkgconfig` for finding system libraries. Included in the repo are two pkgconfig files. If you installed SymEngine or anaconda (or used miniconda) to a different place, you may need to adjust them. Then, you can either set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` path, or copy  the pkgconfig file into a directory already in the path.

3. To actually build:

   ```
   $ swift build
   ```

4. Before you can run anything, you need to make sure that the library can be found at runtime. On macOS set the fallback dylib path:

   ```
   $ export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/anaconda3/lib
   ```

   On linux, look for the right way to add libraries to the system for your distro.

5. Verify the install by running the tests:

   ```
   $ swift test
   ```

## Notes

I have only implemented wrappers for the basic functions so far (no matrices or sets yet). I intend to implement them, but only needed the basics to begin with.
